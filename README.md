# Alzheimer_ML_Project

#### About Project
 This project leverages a Kaggle dataset for analysis. I conducted preliminary data cleaning, including removing unnecessary rows and features. To enhance model performance, I engineered new features by combining existing ones and applying one-hot encoding. For data visualization, I utilized Matplotlib. The machine learning component employed Scikit-learn's logistic regression algorithm.

#### About Dataset

This dataset contains extensive health information for 2,149 patients, each uniquely identified with IDs ranging from 4751 to 6900. The dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. The data is ideal for researchers and data scientists looking to explore factors associated with Alzheimer's, develop predictive models, and conduct statistical analyses.
